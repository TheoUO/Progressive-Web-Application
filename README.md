## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site]()

For this project, I create a text editor where a user can create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection.


## Usage 
This site is quite simple to use. Once you get on the application, you're able to type in whatever notes you wish to and then you may install this app by clicking the install button at the top left.


## Learning Points 
I got to learn more on working with express and making progressive web applications.
